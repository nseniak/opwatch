* Getting started
* Reference documentation generation
* Remove "js" prefix of processor names -- should be implicit
* Generify alert channels (email, other alerters, etc)
* Make JS initialization external files instead of resources, so they can be hacked by the user
* Extension mechanism for adding processors in Java
* Tests
* Better handling of internal errors: deactivate processor
* Way to list the alarms currently toggled on
* Link in alarms for more info
* Persistence?
* Packaging with apt-get and/or others
